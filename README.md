Ember is a lightweight code-scanning framework designed to help developers detect and remove potential malicious code patterns from their projects.

## Features

### Ember#:
- Scans code for common malicious patterns using regular expressions.
- Provides an initial level of defense against common code injection attacks.
- Allows developers to review flagged code and decide whether it's malicious.

### EmberFS:
- EmberFS allows users to search for files on their computer based on a specific query or keyword.
- The graphical user interface (GUI) provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with EmberFS.
- Users can enter a search query to find files that match the provided keyword or phrase.
- EmberFS efficiently scans directories and subdirectories to quickly identify matching files.
- The results are displayed in a scrollable text area, providing users with a clear view of the files found.
- EmberFS displays the timestamp when the search was completed, giving users a sense of how long the process took.
